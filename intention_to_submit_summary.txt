The work presented in this thesis focuses on data analysis for sky-averaged 21-cm experiments. The topic is introduced in Part I, with the scientific background of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal, the challenges faced by experiments aiming to detect the signal and current experimental techniques and results being outlined. Part II introduces a series of novel data analysis tools, and Part III illustrates the application of these tools to real data sets with the aim to constrain the astrophysics of the early universe.

In Part II, chapter 2 discusses the development of an efficient algorithm for fitting functions with constrained derivatives, and smooth properties, to data from sky-averaged 21-cm experiments as a model for the foregrounds. Chapter 3 outlines a novel 21-cm signal emulator, globalemu, that significantly improves on the accuracy and runtime of the previous state-of-the-art. Finally, chapter 4 outlines a framework, called margarine, for performing marginal Bayesian analysis and efficiently combining the constraining power of different data sets.

In Part III, Chapter 5 details the application, in a Bayesian framework, of a derivative constrained foreground model and globalemu to the modelling of data from SARAS2, pioneering concepts key to the Cambridge based REACH experiment and producing weak constraints on the properties of the first galaxies at z=7-12. Chapter 6 is concerned with the derivation of constraints on the properties of the first galaxies at higher redshifts than the previous chapter, z=20, using data from SARAS3, Bayesian analysis and globalemu. This is followed by the application of margarine to the combination of constraints from the sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment SARAS3 and 21-cm power spectrum experiment HERA in chapter 7, through which the limits in the previous chapters on the properties of the first stars are further advanced.

In Part IV, I detail future work plans and conclude.
